# Devlog

The **godot-rust devlog** is a place where development updates are announced, in a way that is more detailed than [Mastodon] and [Twitter/X]. It is intended for readers interested in gdext backgrounds, design choices and an outlook into the future.

We focus on larger improvements and elaborate how they impact gdext users. To keep track of smaller changes, have a look at [pull requests] and consider watching the repository.

If you are new to godot-rust and would like to get started, please refer to the [book] instead.
